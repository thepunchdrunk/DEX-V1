# DEX: Digital Employee Experience

A Contextual Performance Engine designed to remove uncertainty and increase clarity, capability, and forward momentum at work.

## Core Pillars

1. **Context-First Design**
   - Content adapts to user role, tenure, and current task.
   - "Zero-Search" philosophy: Information finds you when you need it.

2. **Active Intelligence**
   - **Impact Dynamics**: Move beyond vanity metrics to career velocity and organizational alignment.
   - **Daily 3 Engine**: Prioritized, actionable cards instead of endless feeds.
   - **Magic Search**: Intent-based navigation and action execution.

3. **Role-Specific Cockpits**
   - **Employee**: Focus on skill growth, daily focus, and insights.
   - **Manager**: "Team Command Center" for unblocking and enabling the team (Servant Leadership structure).

4. **Privacy & Trust**
   - Clear boundaries between "Safe Mode" learning and Manager visibility.
   - User control over development data sharing.
